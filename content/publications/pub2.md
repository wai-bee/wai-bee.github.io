#### 1. Searching for enhancement in coalescence of in-jet (anti-)deuterons in proton-proton collisions

#### Authors: Yoshini Bailung, Neha Shah, Ankhi Roy

##### Abstract

Recent measurements from ALICE report that "in-jet" nucleons carry a higher probability of forming a deuteron via coalescence than the nucleons from the underlying event (UE). This study makes use of an event shape classifier to separate the "in-jet" deuterons and the deuterons in the UE produced in high multiplicity proton-proton collisions at center of mass energy \\(\sqrt{s}\\) = 13 TeV. Event shape variables such as transverse spherocity allow the categorization of hard and soft components of an event, which can be divided into two respective classes; "jetty" and "isotropic". The "jetty" deuterons minus the contribution of the deuterons from the "isotropic" event are taken as "in-jet" deuterons, and the coalescence mechanism is tested. The coalescence is performed with a Wigner function formalism, augmented as an afterburner to PYTHIA8. The possible enhancement of the coalescence probability of "in-jet" deuterons is investigated by calculating the coalescence parameter (\\(B_{2}\\)) in different spherocity classes in high-multiplicity pp collisions.

#### 2. Jet fragmentation via azimuthal angular correlations of heavy flavor decay electrons in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions using PYTHIA8+Angantyr calculations

#### Authors: Ravindra Singh, Yoshini Bailung, Sumit Kumar Kundu, Ankhi Roy

##### Abstract

Measurements in heavy flavor azimuthal angular correlation provide insight into the production, propagation, and hadronization of heavy flavor jets in ultra-relativistic hadronic and heavy-ion collisions. These measurements across different colliding systems, like p--A and A--A, help us isolate the possible modification in particle production due to cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects and the formation of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), respectively. Jet correlation studies give direct access to the initial parton dynamics produced in these collisions. 

This article studies the azimuthal angular correlations of electrons from heavy flavor hadron decays in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions at \\(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}\\) = 5.02 TeV using PYTHIA8+Angantyr. We study the production of heavy flavor jets with different parton level processes, including multi-parton interactions, different color reconnection prescriptions, and initial and final state radiation processes. In addition, we add the hadron-level processes, i.e., Bose-Einstein and rescattering effects, to quantify the effect due to these processes. The heavy flavor electron correlations are calculated in the different trigger and associated \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\) intervals to characterize the impact of hard and soft scattering in the various colliding systems. The yields and the sigmas associated with the near-side (NS) and away-side (AS) correlation peaks are calculated and studied as a function of associated \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\) for different trigger \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\) ranges.

#### 3. Dynamics of particle production in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV using PYTHIA8 Angantyr model

#### Authors: Ravindra Singh, Yoshini Bailung, Ankhi Roy

##### Abstract

We study the dynamics of identified, strange, and multi-strange particle production in Pb--Pb collisions at \\(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}\\) = 2.76 TeV using the recently developed Angantyr model, incorporated within PYTHIA8. We show the interplay between multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) on the experimentally measured quantities. We also investigate the role of string shoving within the rope hadronization framework and its impact in particle production. The charged-particle multiplicity (\\(N_{\mathrm{ch}}\\)) and mean transverse momentum (\\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\)) distributions are well explained by PYTHIA8 Angantyr with proper tuning, as presented in this paper. Predictions of \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\) spectra, \\(\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle\\), \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\) integrated yields of the identified, strange and multi-strange particles are studied. To provide insight into the collective nature of the produced particles, we look into the ratio of particle yields to pions and kaons. PYTHIA8 Angantyr with MPI+CR and hadronization via string shoving is seen to mimic signs of collectivity due to different implementations in string interactions.

#### 4. Dependence of anisotropic flow of net-protons on particlization model for various nuclear equation of state

#### Authors: Sumit Kumar Kundu, Yoshini Bailung, Sudhir Pandurang Rode, Partha Pratim Bhaduri, Ankhi Roy

##### Abstract

We analyze various flow coefficients of anisotropic momentum distribution of final state particles in mid-central (b = 5–9fm) Au+Au collisions in the beam energy range \\({\mathrm{E_{lab}}}\\) = 1A–158A GeV. Different variants of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, namely the pure transport (cascade) mode and the hybrid mode, are employed for this investigation. In the hybrid UrQMD model, the ideal hydrodynamical evolution is integrated with the pure transport calculation for description of the evolution of the fireball. We opt for the different available equations of state (EoS) replicating the hadronic as well as partonic degrees of freedom together with possible phase transitions, viz., hadron gas, chiral + deconfinement EoS, and bag model EoS, to investigate their effect on the properties of the final state particles. We also attempt to gain insights about the dynamics of the medium by studying different features of particle production such as particle ratios and net-proton rapidity distribution. The results and conclusions drawn here would be useful to understand the response of various observables to the underlying physics of the model as well as to make comparisons with the upcoming measurements of the future experiments at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) and the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA).
