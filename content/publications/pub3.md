#### 1. Exploring light nuclei production at RHIC and LHC energies with A Multi-Phase Transport model and a coalescence afterburner

##### Authors: Yoshini Bailung, Neha Shah, Ankhi Roy

##### Abstract

In heavy-ion collisions, understanding how light nuclei species are produced can provide insight into the nature of hadronic interactions in extreme conditions. It can also shed light on understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry and dark matter searches in astrophysical processes. To investigate the production mechanism of light nuclei such as deuteron, triton, and helium-3, we use a naive coalescence afterburner coupled to the well-known "A Multi-Phase Transport model" (AMPT). We focus on studying the production of light nuclei in central Au+Au collisions at different center of mass energies (\\(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}\\) = 19.6, 39, and 200 GeV) and in Pb+Pb collisions at \\(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}\\) = 2.76 TeV, at mid-rapidity. We generate events with the string melting version of AMPT, and feed the information of the nucleons with spatial and momentum conditions into the coalescence afterburner. Our study reports differential and integrated yields in transverse momentum (\\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\)) of the light nuclei in different center of mass energies. We also estimate the coalescence parameters (\\(B_{A}\\)) as a function of \\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\\) and collision energy for (anti-)deuterons, tritons and helium-3s for Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions, which are compared to other light nuclei production studies. All results are compared with measurements from the STAR and ALICE experiments.

#### 2. Effect of various particlization scenarios on anisotropic flow and particle production using UrQMD hybrid model

##### Abstract

We discuss the effect of various particlization scenarios available in the hybrid ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) event generator on different observables in non-central (b = 5â€“9 fm) Au + Au collisions in the beam energy range 1A-158A GeV. Particlization models switch fluid dynamic description to the transport description using various hypersurface criteria. In addition to particlization models, various equations-of-state (EoS) provided by the UrQMD hybrid model were employed. The observables examined in this paper include the excitation function of anisotropic coefficients such as directed (\\(v_{1}\\)) and elliptic flow (\\(v_{2}\\)), particle ratios of the species, and the shape of net-proton rapidity spectra at mid-rapidity. Our findings in this article suggest which particlization scenario among gradual freeze-out (GF, default), isochronous freeze-out (ICF), and iso-energy density freeze-out (IEF) hypersurface, is more reasonable in predicting the available experimental results. The results obtained here can help predict and compare the measurements provided by future experiments at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) and the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) once the data becomes available.
