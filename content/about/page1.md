### Overview

I am an experimental particle physicist, performing research at ALICE 'A Large Ion Collider Experiment' at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. ALICE is designed to study an exotic state of matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), that dates back to the primordial universe (\\(\sim 10^{-6}\\)s after the big-bang). The QGP is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, the fundamental entities of the theory of strong interactions, also known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Under extreme temperature or pressure, the strong forces binding the quarks and gluons together in a proton, no longer hold. ALICE, and a few other experiments, collide heavy ion beams at very high energies and create these conditions creating a laboratoty QGP. This unique state of matter, is an exciting avenue in experimental particle physics that mega science collaborations study and probe.


### Heavy flavours

Charm and beauty quarks, constitute the family of heavy quarks or 'heavy flavours'. Due to their large masses they are formed very early at the initial hard scatterings of a collision, where the momentum transfer \\(\mathcal{Q^{2}}\\) is high. At this regime the strong coupling constant \\(\alpha_{\mathcal{s}}\\) becomes less than unity, where one can calculate the production cross-section as a geometric expansion in \\(\alpha_{\mathcal{s}}\\). This allows for a "perturbative" treatment of heavy flavour production. In the presence of QGP, heavy flavours being produced early, get to traverse the entire evolution of the medium. This means, they carry rich information about the medium that can be extracted via expeirmental observables. Moreover, studying their production is a test to different pertubative QCD calculations. However, their production must be studied where external collective or energy loss effects do not interfere with the dynamics. This is achievable in smaller collision systems, such as proton--proton collisions where a production of QGP is not expected. 

### Light nuclei production via coalescence

Light (anti-)nuclei are bound states or clusters of nucleons, with typical energies of \\(\mathcal{O}(2~\mathrm{MeV})\\). They are produced in collision experiments during the hadronic evolution, where the temperatures are of $\mathcal{O}(100~\mathrm{MeV})$. Their survival in the hot evolving hadron gas is a mystery and remains an open problem among physicists. Theoretical models attempt to describe how light (anti-)nuclei and hyper (anti-)nuclei are produced. Unlike heavy-flavours, the interactions between the nucleons are governed by non-perturbative effects, generally occurring at lower energies than the QCD scale, where the QCD lagrangian cannot be solved analytically. These short-range NN forces are key to understanding the formation of light nuclei. Phenomenological approaches taken by the statistical hadronization model or the coalescence model provide alternate description of their production mechanisms.
