### 🎵

Music is a big part of my life. I grew up with rock and metal music, and now a big listener of progressive rock and metal. I also enjoy covering songs and pieces from my favorite artist with my guitar. Check out some of my covers on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wai_bee11/). 


### 🎮

I love playing and developing video games. I like the idea of being creative in designing independent and small scale indie games. I’m currently learning game development and protyping with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). Check out my published (under continous development 😉) game on [itch.io](https://wai-bee-11.itch.io/save-the-fox)

### ☕️

Big coffee addict and an afficionado. I love brewing fresh coffee, with my favorite blend of beans all over the world.


### 🏏 🏎

I dont play sports but avidly follow cricket and Formula 1.
